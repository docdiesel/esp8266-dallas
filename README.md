This repository contains some small projects regarding the usage of
Dallas DS18B20 temperatur sensor. (Well, at the moment there's just one,
but more will follow soon.)

* esp8266-dallas-multi - use an ESP8266 to read temperatures from multiple
  Dallas sensors, providing the data as plain text and json on a web
  interface.
